    "Association between Device Type and Customer Satisfaction\n",
    "Background:\n",
    "Mizzare Corporation has collected data on customer satisfaction levels for two types of smart home devices: Smart Thermostats and Smart Lights. They want to determine if there's a significant association between the type of device purchased and the customer's satisfaction level.\n",
    "Data Provided:\n",
    "The data is summarized in a contingency table showing the counts of customers in each satisfaction level for both types of devices:\n",
    "Satisfaction     Smart Thermostat    Smart Light    Total\n",
    "Very Satisfied    50                  70            120\n",
    "Satisfied         80                  100           180\n",
    "Neutral           60                  90            150\n",

    "To use the Chi-Square test for independence to determine if there's a significant association between the type of smart home device purchased (Smart Thermostats vs. Smart Lights) and the customer satisfaction level.\n",
    "Assignment Tasks:\n",
    "1. State the Hypotheses:\n",
    "2. Compute the Chi-Square Statistic:\n",
    "3. Determine the Critical Value:\n",
    "Using the significance level (alpha) of 0.05 and the degrees of freedom (which is the number of categories minus 1)\n",
    "4. Make a Decision:\n",
    "Compare the Chi-Square statistic with the critical value to decide whether to reject the null hypothesis.\n"
